//! Canonical event schemas for the campaign contract.
//!
//! # Naming convention (issue #755)
//!
//! Every event follows `<entity>_<past_tense_verb>` in `snake_case`, e.g.
//! `campaign_initialized`, `donation_received`, `withdrawal_finalized`,
//! `dispute_raised`. The verb is always past tense and is the last segment, so
//! an indexer can group a single entity's lifecycle by a stable prefix
//! (`campaign_`, `donation_`, `withdrawal_`, `dispute_`, `refund_`).
//!
//! # Topic layout
//!
//! ```text
//! topics: ( Symbol("<event_name>"), Address /* emitting contract */ )
//! data:   <EventStruct>   // #[contracttype], field order is the wire order
//! ```
//!
//! Topic 0 is always the event name so that a Horizon/RPC `getEvents` filter
//! can select a single event by symbol; topic 1 is the emitting contract address
//! so that a shared emitter (for example the donation contract relaying into the
//! campaign contract) is still attributable.
//!
//! Adding a field to one of these structs is a breaking change for indexers;
//! see `docs/UPGRADE_AND_ROLLBACK.md` ("error code values are permanent").
